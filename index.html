            <h1>How to get started?</h1>
            <p>You might be wondering how to get started so I'll guild you... When I first started out 3 years ago I had no clue on what I was doing until I found out Codecademy! Codecademy is a great place for any beginner to get started in there programming career. (All helpful links are to the right) I first started out learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript. They are tools for you to build a simple website! HTML is for you to structure the website, CSS is to style it, and Javascript is able to make the website interactive with the user! But if you're interested in more hands on tools you could learn Python, Python is a great language for working with machines and data! But what to put the code into?!? Well there are different text editors for different tasks... But I recommend <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> It is easy for anyone and has a active community.</p>
