            <p>Coding Club takes place every Tuesday, at the Vicksburg Middle School in room 404. It goes from 2:30 pm to 4:00 pm. We have many things to do during that time to code! Robots with arduinos, Websites with HTML, or Games with <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>. Mrs. Harbour also gives out snacks if you would like one!</p>
